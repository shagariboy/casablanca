## How I worked on this project

- I used ClickUp to schedule my tasks.
- I built this website based on design form figma and codepen.io.
- I used git commit.


## How to navigate this project

- The css folder contains the Responsive CSS files 
- In the [news page](https://splendid-malabi-f74002.netlify.app/staff.html), the website fetches data from the reqres API and displays the data using responsive CSS
- At the bottom of each page there is a button to scroll up and a navigation progress bar.
- Utilized the emailJs form service
